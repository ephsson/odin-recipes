         <h3>How to make Ciger Tava</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Make the piyaz salad first. Slice the red onion and rub 1-2 tsp salt (preferable sea salt) into the onion slices; this will soften the onions and make them more palatable. Stir in the chopped parsley, ground sumac and black pepper, combine well. Spread the piyaz salad on a serving dish and set aside.</li>
            <li>Slice the liver into chunky bites or stripes (removing skin or ducts).</li>
            <li>Spread the flour on a tray and stir in the red pepper flakes, salt and ground black pepper, mix well. Toss the sliced liver into the flour mixture and make sure all liver pieces have a light coating of the flour mixture.</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil is a wide, heavy pan. In the meantime, place absorbent kitchen paper towel on a clean tray</li>
            <li>Toss in the liver into the hot pan with olive oil and sauté on high heat for about 2-3 minutes each side. The liver pieces will become crispy and have a light brown coating outside but still will be moist and soft inside. Once cooked, remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper towel.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately over the bed of red onion, parsley and sumac salad. We like to serve with a wedge of lemon and squeeze the lemon juicer over the liver while eating; it gives a lovely refreshing taste to the liver and complements the red onion salad well.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Enjoy :)</h3>
