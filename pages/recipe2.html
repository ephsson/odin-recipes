    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Dumplings</strong> in Turkish are called <em>manti</em> and it’s one of the most famous Turkish foods.
         A dough similar to pasta dough is rolled out, cut in tiny squares and filled with a spicy ground lamb or beef filling.
         Traditionally, we serve manti with a garlicky yogurt sauce and a spicy butter sauce on it.

    <p>
        <em>Manti</em> is not only known in Turkey. Just like borek, it is famous in Middle East, Central Asia and Balkan cuisines.
         It has different names in each culture for sure. <em>Manty</em>, <em>mantu</em> and <em>monta</em> are just a few of them.

    <h3>How to make Kayseri Manti</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make dough: Combine flour and salt in a large bowl.
            Add eggs and water, mixing well with your hands. Add more water, if needed, to form a soft dough.
            Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make filling: Shred onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a bowl; drain and discard juice.
            Combine drained onion, ground beef, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; mix well with a spoon until mashed. Set filling aside.</li>
        <li>Lightly flour a work surface and a large plate.</li>
        <li> Divide dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, roll dough on the floured surface into a rectangle as thin as possible. Cut into 2-inch squares using a knife or pastry wheel.</li>
        <li>Place about 2 teaspoons filling in the center of each square. Gather the edges of dough and pinch them together at the top to form a bundle. Transfer manti to the prepared plate; sprinkle more flour on top to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Make oil: Heat oil and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over low heat just until pepper flakes begin to color oil. Remove from heat and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Make sauce: Stir together yogurt and garlic in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook manti in boiling water until filling is no longer pink and dough is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain well.</li>
        <li>Divide manti onto 4 plates. Spoon yogurt sauce over manti and drizzle with pepper oil.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Enjoy :)</h3>
